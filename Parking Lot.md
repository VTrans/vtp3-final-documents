- Contact map could use a lot of work - not sustainable
- Bridges could use some data owner integration


#Internal Requests
- Lots of requests to enhance the map with internal requirements (I need this layer to do ___ too), although not necessarily what the public wants too
- Lots of requests to augment the public map with internal style data.
- Will Portal address these issues? Serve as an internal way to DL the data
- We don't have the development skills to put out something as awesome as UPlan - don't have a team

###Methodology
- We thought having the methodology would be useful to the public, but that it falls outside of our scope.
- How should the agency serve out an explanation of our processes/methods?
- 

###Hosing
- The website lives in GitHub right now
- Does it need to go somewhere else?
- 

###Legacy of VTransparency portal
- Does our site take priority as the one-stop-shop for maps?
- Migrate AGOL here?
- Some of the maps that we have are useless, could be opportunity to cull
- Make an "other" category at the bottom
