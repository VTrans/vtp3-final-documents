###No internal BI tools

- ESRI Operations Dashboards not public facing
- Charting, dashboards are a necessity
- Need development support
- Performance Dashboards
- Maintenance Dashboard
- Winter Material Usage
- Project delivery performance
- Slice the data in other ways
- Pave stats
- Bridge info
- Covered Bridges

###Contacts map
- could use a lot of work - not sustainable
- add emergency contact information

###Internal Requests
- Lots of requests to enhance the map with internal requirements (I need this layer to do ___ too), although not necessarily what the public wants too
- Lots of requests to augment the public map with internal style data.
- Will Portal address these issues? Serve as an internal way to DL the data
- We don't have the development skills to put out something as awesome as UPlan - don't have a team

###Pavement
- Top 10 worst roads

###Methodology
- We thought having the methodology would be useful to the public, but that it falls outside of our scope.
- How should the agency serve out an explanation of our processes/methods?

###Hosing
- The website lives in GitHub right now
- Does it need to go somewhere else?

###Legacy of VTransparency portal
- Does our site take priority as the one-stop-shop for maps?
- Migrate AGOL here?
- Some of the maps that we have are useless, could be opportunity to cull
- Make an "other" category at the bottom
- Internal uses - functional class goes where? public doesn't care
- How does it grow? When Rail goes up?
- Portal and Sharepoint should house everything internal - should be available within a year
- How do you provide everybody with what they need in a way that works for them?

###SeeClickFix
- Take a look at internal GIS solution for the same problem
- Will it work for emergencies too?


###Bridge restrictions
- Structures section needs to get involved

###Projects data issues
- 182/358 did not map (51%), 49% did map
    - Send that number to Marshia every day
- Some were "pretty close"
- We're using anticipated construction dates
- MASS, NY couldn't share data yet
- Force changes
    - Webpage link
    - Bid add date? more reliable?

###Maintenance
- We don't have forward looking maintenance data
- The public sees it as a project, so we need it
