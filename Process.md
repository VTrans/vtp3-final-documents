#How did it work

##Did it work

**Who owns what we just built? What stops somebody from messing it up Monday?**
- Filkorn owns it, just like he oversees the CMS. Scott is an advisor.
- Branch for changes, create a pull request and discuss it before merging

##Next time

- Time frame is project dependent
  - Not worth doing if you only need 2 days
- Do it on projects that need exploration, discussion, discovery
  - Not needed for simple tasks
- Always have a note taker 
  - History, helps you remember, review later
- Daily meetings?
  - Pretty good, especially when we're in the eploring phase
  - Less need once we're underway
  - Timebox 1 meeting?
    - Not useful since we were on track
    - If we were off track then it might have been useful. 
    - Most useful for the oversight committee
    - Hammers home the fact that we were extremely productive
- Chairs made the butts numb
- Best practice would be to have the "product owner" in the room with you


Would participate again:
- Yes all 

"Lead" the next:
- Yes all - for their own projects
- The leader gets everything setup and sold
- Develop the work plan, communicate with leaders
- Needs good communication skills
- All units could benefit from these sprints


###Additions



###Deletions

#Technology

- Leverage existing tools
  - Leverage open source
  - Out of the box tools
- Use tools that live outside of IT - let the users create 
  - People can deploy and iterate on their own
- We tried all the Esri beta tools - good for bleeding edge, 

##Data

#Logistics

###Same room

This would have never worked if we weren't co-located
Sometimes heads down, sometimes lots of talk

Pros (more than cons)
- No waiting
- Quick answers to questions
- Whiteboards
- Gather around the TV to review

Cons
- Sometimes harder to focus
- Interruptions
- Offsite was a little tough for bus commuters
  - Next time could be in the IT training room?
  - Need a place within the building that could be used
  - Something out of the way - basement might be ok
  - Waterbury?


###Next time, share more knowledge
- Publishing services, copying data
- Everyone in the room has the same permissions (or at least elevated for certain issues)
- There were some lynchpins - waiting on a data copy, publish etc
  - Map services, javascript, css, html
- Certain skills should have been shared from the start
  - Balance cross training and productivity
- Exposure is valuable even if the skills didn't transfer - demystifies things

#Method

##Permanent RAD team

Is there any value pulling together a "special ops" team that focuses on one solution until it gets to 80% - "Re-org"
Who carries it after you're gone?? A lot of things fail because they are critical and they leave
We change their business process is now changed and defined so that they can sustain
They train them at the end so they can carry on.

_Sustainability_

How does what we stood up stay standing up? Everything that is built has to sustain itself (with minor maintenance).
