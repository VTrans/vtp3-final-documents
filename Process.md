#How did it work

##Did it work

##Changes

###Additions



###Deletions

#Technology

- Leverage existing tools
  - Leverage open source
  - Out of the box tools
- Use tools that live outside of IT - let the users create 
  - People can deploy and iterate on their own

##Data

#Logistics

###Same room has pros and cons
- More pros
- Sometimes harder to focus
- No waiting

###Next time, share more knowledge
- Publishing services, copying data
- Everyone in the room has the same permissions (or at least elevated for certain issues)
- There were some lynchpins - waiting on a data copy, publish etc
  - Map services, javascript, css, html
- Certain skills should have been shared from the start
  - Balance cross training and productivity
